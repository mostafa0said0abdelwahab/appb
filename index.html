<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
<p>This privacy policy applies to the com.mostafa.said.abdelwahab app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Mostafa Said Abdelwahab (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as an Ad Supported service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".</p>

<br>

<strong>Third Party Services and Ads</strong>
<p>The Application utilizes third-party services for advertising and core functionalities which may have their own Privacy Policies regarding data handling.
